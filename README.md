You are to write an application that is kind of like twitter. It will allow a user to
post a message, and everyone else to see all the messages that have been posted.

It will not allow for following, retweets, direct messages or profiles. It is a 
very basic application, but one that proves what you have learned.

Build an application that allows you to add MESSAGEs, list them and view them (like Lesson 10)

MESSAGEs should look like this:

MESSAGE
long id
String content
Date posteddate
String sentby

the home page ("/") path should point to a list of all MESSAGEs

every page (or template) should have link (or button) to the add path 
("/add") which is the new MESSAGE form

Post the github repository link of your solution...
